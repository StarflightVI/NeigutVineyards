      <h3>Notes From Winemaker - Ken Wright </h3>
      <p>In the famed Willamette Valley, Pinot noir has found its perfect home. Those locations where it naturally excels are a very small percentage of the valley…perhaps five percent at most. One of those special areas is the Yamhill Carlton American Viticultural Area, where Neigut Vineyard is located. 
        The site was planted at an elevation of 400 to 450 feet and has a southeast exposure. Elevation and exposure are critical to successful Pinot noir production. All the highest-quality sites are between 300 and 900 feet in elevation. A southeast exposure will provide full morning sun with lower intensity and limited afternoon sun, which can increase the risk of sunburn or dehydration. In summary, Neigut Vineyard is perfectly situated.
        The soil and geology profile is consistent throughout the site, with three-foot shallow topsoil and ancient marine sediments beneath that drain moisture quickly. The trace elements of the geology impart savory qualities of cola, cedar, chocolate, leather, and clove. The fruit is both blue and black, featuring blueberry, plum, black cherry, and currant.
        Ken Wright Cellars is grateful for the opportunity to work with this world-class Pinot noir site.</p>
